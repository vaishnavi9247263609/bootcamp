HELLO WORLD, THIS IS MY FIRST WEB APPLICATION WHICH IS DONE AS PART OF 3 DAY ONLINE BOOT CAMP FOR LEARNING THE SKILLS REQUIRED BY A WEB DEVELOPER. WE ARE HOSTING THIS WEBSITE THROUGH GITHUB, WHICH IS A GREAT PLATFORM TO STORE ALL THE CODES AND WORK ON THAT. WE CAN COLLABORATELY WORK ON ANY PROJECT ON THIS GITHUB PLATFORM.
